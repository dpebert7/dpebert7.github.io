We've now been living in the tiny house for nearly two weeks. Though there are still more projects to complete (a gate for the top of the stairs, blinds, an awning, and *lots* of landscaping among other things), it feels great to finally experience on a daily basis the reward of all the prior work. For months now I've been looking forward to switching on the bathroom light and taking a hot shower, or sitting on the cube chair I made and enjoying a cup of coffee with breakfast. Experiences like these have been at least as gratifying as I anticipated, and on top of all these I've daily enjoyed the undeserved blessing of seeing beauty outside our windows.


It's true that there are a few things I'd change about the house if I got the chance to do things over again (make the roof rafters look nicer, investigate more geyser options, plan window widths for blinds, etc), but I remind myself that these concerns are meaningless compared to the great joy of living in a new home.
