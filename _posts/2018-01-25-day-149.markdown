With our exterior basically finished, our interior was still bare, as shown in this photo sphere taken by a friend of ours visiting from the US:

After installing 50mm isotherm insulation, we used 9mm plywood to cover the interior. From start to finish, the interior cladding took about 2 1/2 weeks of slow but steady progress.

Throughout the project I've been reliant on my trusty VW Citi Golf for transport. On multiple occasions I drove up the long hill from Pietermaritzburg to the build site with 8 or 9 sheets of plywood strapped to the top. Usually the employees loading the plywood on top of the car were skeptical, but thankfully I never found my car's limit.
