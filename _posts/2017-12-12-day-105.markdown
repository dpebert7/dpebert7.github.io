After nearly 3 months of working together, I dropped my dad off at the Durban airport and said goodbye as he flew back home to Minnesota. Though this has been the best farther-son project I could have imagined, I'll have a lot to finish off after he leaves. Still, I don't know how I could have gotten this far without his help. We worked hard up to the very end of his time here in South Africa, running out of time to go on a hiking trip we'd hoped to fit in. I guess that means he'll have to come back sometime and build a deck!
