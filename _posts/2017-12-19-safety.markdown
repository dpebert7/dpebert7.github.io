Looking back through some old photos of the build, I've been remined of how much safer it is to work on the interior compared to the exterior. Whether working with a mag drill, standing 2 meters above the ground on makeshift scaffolding, or managing a ladder in windy conditions, we've remained safe the entire time aside from a few scrapes and sunburn.
