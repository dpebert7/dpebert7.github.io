Looking back through some old photos of the build, I've been remined of how much safer it is to work on the interior compared to the exterior. Whether working with a mag drill or standing 2 meters above the ground on makeshift scaffolding, or managing a ladder in windy conditions, my dad and I have remained safe the entire time, suffering nothing worse than an occasional scrape or sunburn.
