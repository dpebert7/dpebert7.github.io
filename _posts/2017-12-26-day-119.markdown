Once we had the exterior painted (wood primer, universal undercoat, then two coats of light blue/gray), it was time to add the gutter and some flashing for a finishing touch. There's still a lot of work to do on the inside, but you probably wouldn't know by looking at the outside.

The front of the house:

The back:

My son Bram isn't very handy at the worksite yet and he cries whenever I use any power tools (hearing protection doesn't help even when he's 10 meters away...), but he does bring a great deal of joy and cuteness.
