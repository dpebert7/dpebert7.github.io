Once we had the exterior painted (wood primer, universal undercoat, then two coats of light blue/gray), it was time to add a gutter and flashing for a finishing touch. There's still a lot of work to do on the inside, but you probably wouldn't know by looking at the outside.

My son Bram isn't very handy at the worksite yet and he cries whenever I use any power tools (hearing protection doesn't help even when he's 10 meters away...), but he does bring a great deal of joy and cuteness.
