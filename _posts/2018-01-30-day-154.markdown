Nearly every part of the tiny house neds to be efficient and multipurpose, and to that end I built the stairs to include a lot of storage space. After carefully working out the rise and tread (with a big last step transitioning to the loft), I started building the stairs out of plywood. The stairs turned out to be quite fun to make, and I even managed to make a detachable bottom step to prevent our son from climbing. Now we just need to figure out doors to keep him from the storage.
