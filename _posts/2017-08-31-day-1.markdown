After months of dreaming, researching, learning, and planning the tiny house build, August 31 marked the first day of construction when I cut several steel tags which will eventually hold the loft and ceiling rafters in place. Though it's really hard to predict how long the build will take, I hope to move into the tiny house 100 days from now. My wife's dream is that we'll get to spend Christmas in our new home. Regardless of the small steps I took on this first day, I went home this first day excited that our tiny house was no longer entirely conceptual.
