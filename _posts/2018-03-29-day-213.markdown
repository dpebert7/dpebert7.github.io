More than any other part of the house, our moveable loft involved repeated rounds of invention and experimentation, and a **lot** of pulleys and counterweights. After several months of various configurations, I'm satisfied with the following setup:

 - Four sliding door Hillaldam rails and wheels, repurposed for each corner of the loft
 - Pegs in holes hold the platform wheels in place when the pulley isn't engaged
 - Platform built from pine timber with plywood floor
 - Five security gate wheels repurposed as single pulleys
 - Two double pulleys and two more standard pulleys, these allow the ropes connected to each corner to join into one rope
 - One quadruple pulley with one end attached to the floor and the other to the single rope provides substantial mechanical advantage to easily raise the
 - Wall hook to secure dangling rope to the wall

Here's a video demonstration, originally made for my curious dad who was essential in starting the loft but who didn't get to see it to completion:
