When my wife and I -- mostly my wife -- started to dream about building a tiny house back in early 2016, the one thing we knew most that hasn't changed at all is the fact that we need a lot of help. Neither of us has taken on a project like this before, and we completely lack tools and an understanding of South African building methods and practices. 

Our plans only became serious when we connected with Steve in early 2017. At that time, Steve was just finishing his first tiny house and had a dream of building all kinds of tiny, modular, and container houses.

Write about Steve's tiny houses and how much he's helped us.

Then write about Dad and how much he's helped.
