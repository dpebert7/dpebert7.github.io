I have no welding experience. When I arrived at the build site in mid-July, I received one lesson, and after a bit of practice I never accomplished a weld better than *chicken shit*. For this and a lot of other reasons, I'm grateful for Jamie and Steve, who helped the build get off the trailer by welding 36 meters of steel beams to the frame.
