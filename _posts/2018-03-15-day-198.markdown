After months of working on the trailer in one location, the time came to move the house to its new home. I paid some neighbors with moving experience and watched nervously as the trailer navigated our friends' steep driveway and rolled down the hill to its resting terrace. Though in the end everything went according to plan, I felt jittery even 24 hours afterward, and one of the movers later commented that the morning may have taken years off his life.

One of the most common misconceptions about the tiny house is that we could take it camping if we wanted. To the contrary, I look forward to plumbing the house in and seeing it **not** move for a very long time.
