Welcome to my new blog! On most days I'm a mathematician, teacher, and data enthusiast. However, since July 2017 I've been living in Hilton, South Africa while learning about [tiny home construction][tiny-house-wiki]. In the early stages of this blog (and as I figure out how to blog with [Jekyll][jekyll-site]...) I'll be writing about my adventure building a tiny house for my family. Thanks for reading!
